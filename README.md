A science fiction novel. The first part of a series of novels set in the same universe.

This is a second draft. I rewrote the whole thing. After many, many rejections from agencies.

Hopefully this new version is more to their liking.

At the very least, I'm a lot more excited about it.

It does start a bit slow, like the first one did. That's unavoidable.

It's now much longer. But I'm hoping it's more engaging. And fun. And hopefully engaging.

I'm also already in the process of writing the second book in the series.

I stopped writing after all the rejections. But I started again after reworking the first book.

Fuck it. You only live once, right?
