A science fiction novel. The first part of a series of novels set in the same universe.

This is a second draft. I rewrote the whole thing. After many, many rejections from agencies.

Hopefully this new version is more to their liking.

At the very least, I'm a lot more excited by it.

It does start a bit slow, and it's now much longer. But I'm hoping it's more engaging.

I'm also already in the process of writing the second book in the series. I stopped writing after all the rejections. But I started again after reworking the first book. Fuck it. You only live once, right?
